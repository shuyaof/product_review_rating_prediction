# Product Review Rating Prediction
In this GitHub repository, I have managed the complete lifecycle of a machine learning project that predicts product ratings from new reviews. I utilized NLTK libraries for text preprocessing and leveraged Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization. I implemented a TF-IDF conversion process and chose the most fitting model between Scikit-Learn's Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression, fine-tuning hyperparameters such as C, multi-class, and max iterations. To ensure the robustness of the model, I employed a 5-fold cross-validation approach during training. This effort achieved a predictive accuracy of 65% on new reviews, and I have successfully deployed the model on Azure's public endpoint.
